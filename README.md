## OFX Manager ##

**OFX Manager**  is a stand-alone tool for downloading financial information from supporting institutions.

### Search for Institutions ###

OFX Manager uses the database at [OFX Home](http://www.ofxhome.com/ "OFX Home") to find financial institutions that support downloading transactions using the OFX standard. If your financial institution is not available, you can add it to OFX Home. 


### Download Transactions ###

By including your financial institution login information, OFX Manager will contact your bank and download transactions for the specified time period. While the [OFX standard](http://ofx.net/ "OFX standard") supports many types of transactions - including credit cards and bill payment - OFX Manager will only supports transaction history. 

Your financial information is safe with OFX Manager - passwords are never stored in managed memory and all transactions are done via SSL.
